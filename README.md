# CS50: Introduction to Computer Science
#### *Note: As per CS50x's Academic Dishonesty guidelines, my solution code will not be made public. If applicable, please contact me through the details I have provided to view my solutions for verification purposes.*

This is CS50x through edX, Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. Taught by David J. Malan, CS50x teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. 

Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. The Problem Sets are inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. It also teaches students how to develop and present a final programming project. 

Wherever possible, I had attempted the more comfortable versions of the Labs & Problem Sets as well as attempted all the Weekly Practice Problems. This repository will be updated constantly as I continue to complete this course. The Final Project, named [Staid,](https://github.com/omcodedthis/Staid) has been added to a separate repository.

## Weekly Scores
The Labs & Problem Sets for each week are graded in two segments. [check50](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/projects/check50/en/latest/index.html) checks for the correctness of the code & [style50](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/style50/) checks for the style of how a program was written. The scores are recorded in the bottom-left corner of each submission. By clicking on the image, you can view an enlarged version in a new tab.
